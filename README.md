## Project Overview
Real estate in the USA is a diverse and dynamic market that varies significantly by region. Some key facts and trends in the US real estate market include:
1. Housing Market: The US housing market saw a significant increase in demand, driven by cheap mortgage rates, remote work habits, and shifting lifestyle tastes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, Home values rose as a result in several locations.
2. Home Prices: Home prices saw significant appreciation in various metropolitan areas, making housing affordability a concern for many potential buyers. Cities like San Francisco, Seattle, and Austin saw substantial price increases.
3. Urban Migration: The pandemic accelerated the trend of people moving away from densely populated urban areas to suburban and rural locations. 
4. Real Estate Technology: The use of technology in real estate, such as virtual property tours, digital mortgage applications, and blockchain-based property records, continued to evolve.

According to Redfin article: <a href="https://www.redfin.com/us-housing-market" target="blank">United States Housing Market </a>, we are able to see an overview of the United States Housing Market, Demand, Supply.

For this project,we are given the King County House Sales as our base dataset.We are required to use multiple linear regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county. 

We will be required to Import/Load, Clean, Visualize and Model the data provided. This will enable us to answer the objectives set and provide Recommendations and insights to our audience stakeholders.

## Business Understanding

### Stakeholder Audience
Fanaka Group, a Real Estate Investment Group is the identified stakeholders for this prject. This group deals with buying, selling, renovating and finanacing properties.
The group is seeking for ways it can provide better housing facilities for their clients. They are seeking to improve their efficiency ad effectiveness in delivering their facilities to their clients.

They have asked us to provide insights and recommendations into the real estate market in terms of which houses and renovation features are likely to give them a significant profit on their investment. 


### Business Objectives
The aim of this project is to analyze the provided dataset on King Country and eventually answer to the Stakeholders questions.
With this in mind, the objectives of this project include:
1. To model and understand the relationship between house sales prices and multiple independent variables(ie the house features).
2. Valuation of the property: 
Identify the key factors that affect house prices in the northwestern county.
3. Customer satisfaction: 
Identify the key factors (features of attraction) affect house sales
4. Provide insights and recommendations to the stakeholders in regards to their investing

## Data Understanding
For this project, we will use the King County House Sales dataset under the file path `data\...` This folder contains historical data of house sales captured in a northwestern country, which we will modify for the purpose of our analysis.

The data folder includes the following files:
1. `column_names.md` - provides a description of the column names
2. `kc_house_data.csv` - provides list of attributes for the houses and their prices


### Visualization
We are able to see how the various features affect pricing of the houses sold

## Modelling
For this project, we will require use of multiple linear regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county. Multiple linear regression is a statisitical technique used to determine the relationship among several random variables. 

For this project, we will use multiple linear regression, to help us understand and determine the relationship between multiple independent variables (house features) and the dependent variable, which in this case is House Sale Prices.
