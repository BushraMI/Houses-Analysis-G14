### Stakeholder Audience
Fanaka Group, a Real Estate Investment Group is the identified stakeholders for this prject. This group deals with buying, selling, renovating and finanacing properties.
The group is seeking for ways it can provide better housing facilities for their clients. They are seeking to improve their efficiency ad effectiveness in delivering their facilities to their clients.

They have asked us to provide insights and recommendations into the real estate market in terms of which houses and renovation features are likely to give them a significant profit on their investment. 


### Business Objectives
The aim of this project is to analyze the provided dataset on King Country and eventually answer to the Stakeholders questions.
With this in mind, the objectives of this project include:
1. To model and understand the relationship between house sales prices and multiple independent variables(ie the house features).
2. Valuation of the property: 
Identify the key factors that affect house prices in the northwestern county.
3. Customer satisfaction: 
Identify the key factors (features of attraction) affect house sales
4. Provide insights and recommendations to the stakeholders in regards to their investing

## Data Understanding
For this project, we will use the King County House Sales dataset under the file path `data\...` This folder contains historical data of house sales captured in a northwestern country, which we will modify for the purpose of our analysis.

The data folder includes the following files:
1. `column_names.md` - provides a description of the column names
2. `kc_house_data.csv` - provides list of attributes for the houses and their prices



## Modelling
For this project, we will require use of multiple linear regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county. Multiple linear regression is a statisitical technique used to determine the relationship among several random variables. 

For this project, we will use multiple linear regression, to help us understand and determine the relationship between multiple independent variables (house features) and the dependent variable, which in this case is House Sale Prices.
